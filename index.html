                        I am a KICP Fellow at the University of Chicago. My principal research interest is gravitational
                        lensing and observational cosmology. I work with galaxy-galaxy strong
                        lenses and strongly lensed quasar/supernova systems to
                        measure cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant and to study properties of
                        elliptical galaxies at the intermediate redshift (\(z\sim0.5\)). <br />

                                <p>
                                    In a strong lens creating multiple images of a time-variable background source
                                    (quasar or SN), photons from the source that appear in different lensed images
                                    travel different cosmological distances
                                    around the foreground galaxy. Therefore, the measured time delay between the photon
                                    arrivals of the different images allows us to constrain a combination of these
                                    cosmological distances, which then
                                    provides a direct measurement of \(H_0\). The <a

                                    of evolving dark energy. This new model avoids going into the phantom regime
                                    (invoking exotic physics by having negative kinetic energy), that the widely-used
                                    \(w_0 w_a\) parametrization does by crossing the null energy condition (NEC) line. I

                                    The seven time-delay analyses from the TDCOSMO collaboration have assumed simple
                                    parametric forms for the
                                    mass profile, such as the power law, which is
                                    a potential systematic if the true mass
                                    profile in elliptical galaxies deviates from
                                    this assumption. <a
                                        href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26A...643A.165B/abstract">We have

                                    kinematics. Relaxing this assumption
                                    increases the \(H_0\) uncertainty from 2% to

                        I am the creator of the <a href="https://www.astrobridge.org/home">Astro Bridge</a> program, an
                        initiative aimed at offering research experience to undergraduate students who come from
                        communities or countries
                        with limited access to such opportunities. By providing fully online programs, Astro Bridge aims
                        to engage multiple students in a single collaborative project, ensuring access for a large
                        number of
                        participants. <b>So far, four Bangladeshi students from this bridge program have been accepted

                        In the pilot project within this program, I have mentored 19 undergraduate students
                        from Bangladesh. Our project focuses on analyzing strong lensing systems, utilizing data
                        obtained from the
                        <i>Hubble Space Telescope</i>. We have submitted a journal article from this project (

                        ) that is currently under peer
                        review. <i>This single paper has roughly tripled the number of published astronomers from
